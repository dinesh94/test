Notes :-

git clone
Once you done with changes 
git add
git commit
git log - Show logs with local
git status - Show status with remote
git push - once you are ready to move local changes to remote

if you are using git-gui
For pull - You need to go to 
1. remote -> fetch
2. Then you need to do merge, Merge -> Local Merge
3. Then commit merged file, Commit -> Stage to commit
4. Then you need to push your changes to remote 
This way the merge will work
